JavaScript Automatopia
======================

A JavaScript seed project with build, test, CI, and deployment workflow automation, based on the original work by James Shore (https://github.com/jamesshore/automatopia)

CHANGES to Jame's version:
- moved tests to separate directory tree
- removed trailing underscores from test file names
- added JsHamcrest assertion library (https://github.com/danielfm/jshamcrest), and made available both to client and server tests.
